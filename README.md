This is the testcase for testing fish model code
0D model is the default fabm0d driver. 1D folder is gotm 1d driver.
This is for testing foraging arena theory in FABM-PCLake model, by implementing alternative prey-predator relation, foraging arena function, between trophic levels of, zooplankton-zooplanktivorous fish, zooplanktivorous fish - piscvorous fish, benthivorous fish - piscvorous fish.
